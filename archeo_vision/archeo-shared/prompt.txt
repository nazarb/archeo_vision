You are provided with an image containing several pottery pieces and labels. The image also includes a yellow sticky note with a label and a scale bar for reference.

Your task is to create a JSON file that includes the following information:

1. The main label written on the yellow card (main_label)
2. The image dimensions as you perceive them (image_size) - IMPORTANT: report the width and height of the image as you see it
3. Annotations for each pottery piece, including:
   - Their bounding box coordinates in format [left, top, right, bottom] using PIXEL coordinates RELATIVE to the image dimensions you reported
   - The label text written on each pottery piece

CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:
- First, determine the image dimensions you are processing and include them in "image_size" field
- Use ABSOLUTE PIXEL coordinates (not normalized 0-1 values) relative to YOUR PERCEIVED image dimensions
- Format: [left, top, right, bottom]
- Carefully read ALL text on pottery pieces
- Your coordinates must match the dimensions you report in image_size

Return ONLY this exact JSON format:
```json
{
  "main_label": "text from yellow sticky note",
  "image_size": "width, height",
  "annotations": [
    {
      "bbox_2d": [left, top, right, bottom],
      "label": "text on pottery piece"
    }
  ]
}
```

Example:
```json
{
  "main_label": "2025-B2164-A3",
  "image_size": "2560, 975",
  "annotations": [
    {
      "bbox_2d": [88, 97, 252, 222],
      "label": "D25B2164A3-4"
    },
    {
      "bbox_2d": [274, 134, 472, 294],
      "label": "D25B2164A3-1"
    }
  ]
}
```
