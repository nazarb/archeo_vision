Analyze this image and detect all visible objects (animals, people, vehicles, etc.).

For EACH object, provide:
- "label": specific object type (e.g., "dog", "cat", "person", "car")
- "box": bounding box in NORMALIZED YOLO format [x_center, y_center, width, height]

YOLO FORMAT REQUIREMENTS:
- All values must be normalized between 0.0 and 1.0
- x_center: horizontal center position (0.0 = left edge, 1.0 = right edge)
- y_center: vertical center position (0.0 = top edge, 1.0 = bottom edge)  
- width: box width as fraction of image width
- height: box height as fraction of image height
- The box should tightly enclose the ENTIRE object

Return ONLY valid JSON:
```json
[
  {"label": "object_type", "box": [x_center, y_center, width, height]}
]
```

Example: A dog in the center covering half the image would be:
{"label": "dog", "box": [0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5]}
