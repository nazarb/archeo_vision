Detect all objects in this image. Return the results as a JSON array with each object having:
- "label": the object class name (e.g., "dog", "cat", "person", "car")
- "box": 8 coordinates [x1, y1, x2, y2, x3, y3, x4, y4] representing the 4 corners in pixel coordinates

Format the response as valid JSON:
```json
[
  {
    "label": "object_name",
    "box": [x1, y1, x2, y2, x3, y3, x4, y4]
  }
]
```

Be specific with labels and ensure all coordinates are in pixel values.
